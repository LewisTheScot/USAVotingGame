# USA Voting game

A game based on the barriers to voting in the USA. 

it's very simple but very tricky to win. 

The games meant to be retro with a nod to Lemmings done in Vanilla JavaScript only.

1st time posting on github and hoping to make fun and practical projects.

## The Game

Simple grid based game where you the Voter has to reverse a series of obstacles to get to Vote in this year's election. The obstacles are ridiculous, hurrices, fires, covid, polce, white supremisits and COVID, but that's now life in the USA.
